# What is Git?

-- GIT(1) Manual

Git is a **fast**, **scalable**, **distributed** revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.


---

# Why Revision Control?

- Collaboration
- Storing Versions
- Restoring Previous Versions
- Understanding What Happened
- Backup (side-effect)

---

# How to?

- cp
- Centralized (e.g. CVS, Subversion)
- Distributed (e.g. Git, Mercurial, Bazaar)

---
# Why Git?

- Branching and Merging
- Small and Fast
- Distributed
- Data Assurance
- Staging Area
- Free and Open Source
- **World Wide Popular**

# Git Basics

# Snapshots, Not Differences

_Storing data as changes to a base version of each file._

_Storing data as snapshots of the project over time._

---

# Nearly Every Operation Is Local

- Entire repository right there on your local disk
- Browse the history, see the changes introduced between any versions
- Work offline

---

# Git Has Integrity

## Everything in Git is check-summed (SHA-1 hash)

---

# Git Generally Only **Adds** Data

# About Remote Repositories

- Clones
- Remote repositories can be anywhere
- A repository can have more than one remote

---

# Remote repositories can be anywhere!

- Public git hosting services (e.g. Github, Bitbucket)
- Self hosting centralized server
- Other computer
- Other directories

---

# Getting a Git Repository

Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory

```sh
$ git init
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m 'First commit'
```

---

# More Basic Operations

```sh
$ git status                      # Show the working tree status
$ git rm some_file.txt            # Remove files from the working directory and staging area
$ git mv <source> <destination>   # Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
$ git log                         # Show the commit history log
$ git diff                        # Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
$ git help                        # Show the most commonly used git commands
$ git help subcommand             # Show the subcommand help
```

# Branching

_A branch in Git is simply **a lightweight movable pointer** to one of these commits._

# Getting a Git Repository

Cloning an Existing Repository

```sh
$ git clone <repository> [directory]

- ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
- git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
- http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
- ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/
- rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/
- [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/
- file:///path/to/repo.git/
- /path/to/repo.git/
```

---

# Show Remote Repositories

```sh
$ git remote
$ git remote -v
$ git remote add <name> <url>
$ git fetch [remote-name]
```

---

# Some Tips

- Modify last commit message

```sh
$ git commit --amend              # Now you can write commit message again
```

- Forget to add a file?

```sh
$ git commit -m 'do some changes'  # Assume we forgot to add another file `README.md`
$ git add README.md                # We add the forgotten file
$ git commit --amend               # Then we add the file in the last commit!
```

# Best Practises - "DO"s

- Do read about git
- Do commit early and often
- Do test before you commit
- Do choose a workflow
- Do make useful commit messages
- Do keep up to date
- Do use useful tools

---

# Best Practises - "DON'T"s

- Don't panic
- Don't change published history
- Don't rewrite public history
- Don't change where a tag points
- Don't commit anything that can be regenerated from other things that were committed
- Don't commit configuration files
- Don't commit large binary files (when possible)
- Don't create very large repositories (when possible)
- Don't use reset (--hard || -merge) without committing/stashing
- Don't prune the reflog
